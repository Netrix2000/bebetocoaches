<h2>WORKING EXPERINCE</h2>
<p>
    I have really travelled through many different companies across the world,<br>

want to asure you that my journey has<br> been alot more easier than I thought it would be.
<br>
<br>Software Engineering has been my thing ever since I was twelve, I always<br> admired the act of computers,
therefore I made an oth that I would achieve<br> what I really want in the future.
